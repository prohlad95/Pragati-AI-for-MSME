# Model Card

## Model Name

Pragati MSME Financial Health Engine

## Intended Use

Competition prototype for MSME credit-readiness assessment using alternate-data signals.

## Not Intended For

- Real lending decisions
- Automated rejection without human review
- Use without consented borrower data
- Production deployment without calibration and governance review

## Inputs

- Monthly digital inflow
- GST filing delay
- UPI transaction density
- Sales volatility
- Vendor payment delay
- Average bank balance
- EPFO/payroll stability
- Consent-source availability

## Outputs

- Financial health score
- Probability of default estimate
- Decision recommendation
- Suggested credit limit
- Expected loss
- Explanation factors

## Fairness Considerations

The prototype includes a Disparate Impact Ratio view. In production, fairness must be tested across geography, gender, industry, business age, firm size, and protected or sensitive cohorts where legally and ethically appropriate.

## Limitations

The current prototype uses synthetic and manually adjustable inputs. Performance claims should not be interpreted as real-world model accuracy. Production usage requires lender repayment data, monitoring, model calibration, and regulatory review.
